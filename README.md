# Frontend CRUD - Book Management Application

This is a **Book Management Application** built using **Angular 19.1.7** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** with **PostgreSQL** for the backend. It provides a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing books.

The frontend leverages modern Angular features along with **PrimeNG** components for an enhanced user interface and **PrimeFlex** for responsive layout management, minimizing the need for custom CSS.

## Overview

This branch is used for the online deployment of the application. The application itself is the same as in the [simple-book-management](https://github.com/pablodiazjorge/crud-frontend/tree/simple) branch, but with environment variable configurations that enable secure deployment to the Vercel platform.

It integrates seamlessly with a Spring Boot backend connected to a PostgreSQL database for persistent cloud storage.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The deployment is hosted using free-tier plans. As a result, the backend server may go into hibernation after periods of inactivity. When this happens, the first request may take a couple of minutes to respond while the server starts up. If the data does not load initially, it is recommended to wait a couple of minutes until the server is ready.
